A few months ago, I had the opportunity to present a brief "lunch and learn" type
demonstration on an approach to automated GUI testing. I told everyone that the source
code would be made available on my personal GitLab instance, and added a few people
into the repository who requested access -- and then discovered that it's set up to send
lots of automated email notifications, and access from outside my network is not necessarily always
the most reliable. If you were one of those few lucky people, please do accept my
apologies! I've moved the source code and slides into a public GitHub repo for easier access.

### Source Code

The source code from the presentation can be found in 
[my fuzzy-telegram GitHub repo](https://github.com/jtucker276/fuzzy-telegram).

### Presentation Slides

The fuzzy-telegram repo readme links you to
[these presentation slides on Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13r4RROA3o9cOPFbd5_pNGUC9gUVRsBI1zndQzgwSOnE/edit?usp=sharing).
You can also find them in the repo.
